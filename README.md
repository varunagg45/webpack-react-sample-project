## Synopsis

Short project that I created. Inspired from the blog posts https://robots.thoughtbot.com/setting-up-webpack-for-react-and-hot-module-replacement by Blake Williams and  http://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html from Jonathan Petitcolas. I created this project only for learning purpose, it's a very basic project for beginners.

## Setup

* At the root of the project `npm install`, `npm start`
* Open browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/pages/dashboard.html`

## Motivation

After going through the training for reactjs from `@ryanflorence` and `@mjackson`, who were consistenly using webpack I got too curious to try it out.
